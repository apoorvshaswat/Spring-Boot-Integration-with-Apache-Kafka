# Spring Boot Integration with Apache Kafka

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to integrate **Apache Kafka** with **Spring Boot** to build a scalable, fault-tolerant messaging system. Apache Kafka allows the exchange of messages between distributed systems, and this application shows how Spring Boot can simplify Kafka setup and communication. The application consists of a producer service that sends messages to a Kafka topic and a consumer service that listens for those messages

## Features
- **Producer**: Sends messages to Kafka topics.
- **Consumer**: Listens for messages from Kafka topics.
- **Spring Boot Integration**: Simple setup for Kafka integration with Spring Boot.
- **Kafka Topics**: Topics for handling messages between producer and consumer.
- **Real-time Messaging**: Handles real-time message streaming with Kafka.

## Technologies Used
- Java 8
- Spring Boot
- Apache Kafka
- Spring Kafka (for integration)
- Gradle

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
Before running the project, ensure you have the following:
- **Java 8** or higher
- **Apache Kafka** installed and running locally, or use a cloud-based Kafka service (e.g., Confluent Cloud)
- **Zookeeper** (required by Kafka, usually comes with Kafka installation)
- **Gradle** for managing dependencies
